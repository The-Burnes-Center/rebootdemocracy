But public professionals in the U.S. — the nation’s largest workforce — are not required to learn the latest digital skills to serve communities. This is leading to a widening gap between the skills our public workers have (and want), and the ones citizens need.</p><p data-block-key="6l7fv"><a href="https://innovate-us.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-analytics-onclick="{&quot;event&quot;:&quot;page interaction&quot;,&quot;category&quot;:&quot;in-article links&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:&quot;link click&quot;,&quot;label&quot;:&quot;https://innovate-us.org/&quot;}">InnovateUS</a>&nbsp;is focused on closing that gap. We train public sector professionals in digital, data and community engagement skills to deliver services and make policy — not just efficiently, but effectively and equitably. Equipping public professionals with these skills can change how people work in government and how governments work for people. It can improve career mobility for public workers, foster a trusted relationship between citizens and their government, help us collaboratively address the pressing challenges of our time, and ultimately forge a stronger democracy.</p><p data-block-key="1lt99"><a href="http://google.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-analytics-onclick="{&quot;event&quot;:&quot;page interaction&quot;,&quot;category&quot;:&quot;in-article links&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:&quot;link click&quot;,&quot;label&quot;:&quot;http://google.org/&quot;}">Google.org</a>&nbsp;is providing $2 million in funding to help us expand digital skills training to more than 50,000 government workers across at least 15 states.

And Google.org will provide pro bono support, including user experience researchers and designers, to ensure that participants can easily explore and access courses as we add more to the curriculum, and even propose their own.</p><p data-block-key="d3jbo">These new offerings will build on InnovateUS’s wide range of existing programming.
