At the same time, GenAI could also create challenges from eroding job quality to eliminating jobs altogether. To enable policies and programs that respond to communities’ concerns, it is crucial for public institutions to understand how residents expect technology to change how we work.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">That’s why, with our help, New Jersey’s <a href="https://www.nj.gov/governor/news/news/562023/20231010b.shtml">AI Task Force</a> is using the collective intelligence tool All Our Ideas, to <a href="https://innovation.nj.gov/ai-and-you/">ask workers</a> to share their greatest hopes and concerns about the impact of GenAI on work in the Garden State. <a href="https://all-our-ideas.citizens.is/domain/1">All Our Ideas</a> is an innovative online engagement tool used to create a rank-ordered list based on public input. Instead of having to answer a long list of questions, respondents are shown two answer choices in response to the question: “Over the next five years, what will be the biggest effect from generative AI on the workforce in New Jersey?”&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Participants <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qpTd3ULqNTdIOuMXgRD4rwgSDsa1bfdB/view?pli=1">select between pairs of statements</a> as many or as few times as they wish. The answer choices cover a range of challenges including job displacement, economic instability and threats to worker power. The statements also include opportunities such as the potential of AI to create new job opportunities, make work more meaningful, and aid in job matching and career development.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr"><img src="https://content.thegovlab.com/assets/dded73d4-0d0a-4511-a13c-bf203e525b9b?width=2134&amp;height=1340" alt="Screen Shot 2024 07 29 at 4.19.49 Pm"></p><p dir="ltr">As responses come in, the tool creates a rank-ordered list showing the most selected and least selected answer choices in real time. Public input will help the State to understand what respondents see as the greatest opportunities and risks.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr"><img src="https://content.thegovlab.com/assets/d258f08f-5d02-46c1-b1df-e2e2fa96070a?width=1494&amp;height=1330" alt="Screen Shot 2024 07 29 at 4.20.19 Pm"></p><p dir="ltr">Following the engagement, the Task Force will develop policy recommendations that respond to the public’s greatest concerns using the AI-based toolkit <a href="https://rebootdemocracy.ai/blog/smarter-crowdsourcing-and-policy-synth-report">Policy Synth</a>. Developed by the GovLab and <a href="https://citizens.is/">Citizens Foundation</a>, Policy Synth leverages AI agents to conduct<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13960"> large-scale automated web research</a> in order to rapidly develop a set of solutions to urgent public problems. The output will be a set of evidence-based policy recommendations for how New Jersey can address AI-driven impacts on the state’s economy and workforce. The recommendations will also be informed by learnings from a <a href="https://www.govtech.com/artificial-intelligence/new-jersey-co-creates-ai-strategy-with-public-sector-staff">survey</a> of New Jersey’s public sector workforce which asked public servants about their knowledge, attitudes and interests around AI.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p dir="ltr">“AI and You” is the latest in a series of public consultations that the GovLab has helped to design or facilitate using the All Our Ideas tool, including:&nbsp;</p><ul><li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"><p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><a href="https://unlockingliteracy.ai/">Unlocking Literacy</a> (2023-2024): Facilitated a national engagement to understand perspectives on the causes of low literacy in support of the <a href="https://www.bostonpublicschools.org/Page/9241">Chief of Teaching and Learning</a> for Boston Public Schools and Boston’s <a href="https://www.mos.org/">Museum of Science</a>.</p></li><li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"><p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><a href="https://www.itsourturn.org/student_agenda">Our Turn Student Agenda</a> (2023): Provided training and guidance to support education advocacy group <a href="https://www.itsourturn.org/">Our Turn</a> in engaging students across the country to understand how young people want to see the education system change.</p></li><li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"><p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><a href="https://cip.org/alignmentassemblies">Alignment Assemblies on AI</a> (2023): Supported the <a href="https://cip.org/">Collective Intelligence Project</a> in its efforts to ask the US public what to measure and mitigate when it comes to risks and harms of large language models (LLMs).&nbsp;</p></li><li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"><p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><a href="https://youreducationyourvoice.org/">Your Education, Your Voice</a> (2021): Facilitated two engagements with students, caregivers, and educators to understand the greater opportunities and needs when it comes to education.
