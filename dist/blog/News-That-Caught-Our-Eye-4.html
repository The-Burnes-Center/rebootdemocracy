The workforce-development initiative claims to bridge the digital divide and prepare Europeans for the evolving AI landscape. It begs the question: how will participating non-profits and social enterprises be chosen?</p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h3 dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-dcf4f56d-7fff-cb54-487b-104f3f53ecee">Pakistan’s Imran Khan uses AI to make victory speech from jail</strong></h3><p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-b48d7c67-7fff-e77a-a882-b94aa7195fbb"><a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/pakistans-imran-khan-use-ai-artificial-intelligence-make-victory-speech-from-jail/?utm_source=www.theneurondaily.com&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=7-trillion">Politico</a> (February 11, 2024)</strong></p><p dir="ltr">While concerns over deepfakes in elections persist, former Pakistani PM Khan's AI speech highlights their potential for positive uses like training videos and public service announcements. This underscores the need for responsible regulation of the tech’s uses, rather than the tech itself – to harness AI's potential while mitigating risks.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h3 dir="ltr">The FCC bans robocalls with AI-generated voices</h3><p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-6d644d37-7fff-2e51-4caa-008be49af626"><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/8/24066169/fcc-robocall-ai-voices-ban">The Verge</a> (February 8, 2024)</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Last week, the FCC clarified existing regulations and clamped down on AI-powered robocalls, empowering state attorneys general to combat deceptive practices. While vigilance against AI misuse in elections is crucial, politicos should also recognize its mass potential for positive applications to citizen engagement.

A new report by the Brennan Center warns that lawmakers are falling behind on understanding and implementing technologies.
