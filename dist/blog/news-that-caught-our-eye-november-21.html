Speaking at the Rebooting Democracy in the Age of AI Lecture Series, McCourt criticized the centralized control of data by tech giants, likening it to a "feudal Internet" where platforms act as modern monarchs. He advocates for a "New Net" with user-owned identities, portable data, and value-driven engagement, using a potential TikTok acquisition to showcase this vision. While his approach emphasizes personal data sovereignty, critics argue that collective governance and democratic institutions are essential for tackling shared digital challenges like misinformation, content moderation, and algorithmic bias. McCourt calls for bipartisan collaboration to ensure technology serves humanity, balancing individual rights with societal needs.<strong><br></strong></p><h2 dir="ltr">AI And Public Engagement</h2><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsta.2024.0113">Co-creating the future: participatory cities and digital governance</a> - Royal Society Publishing, Dirk Helbing et al, November 13, 2024</p><p dir="ltr">“The digital revolution, fueled by advancements in social media, Big Data, the Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence, is reshaping our urban landscapes into ‘participatory cities’. These cities leverage digital technologies to foster citizen engagement, collaborative decision-making and community-driven urban development, thus unlocking new potentials while confronting emerging threats. Such technologies are empowering individuals and organizations in ways that were unimaginable just a few years ago. They do, however, introduce new risks and vulnerabilities that must be carefully managed. Hence, socio-technical innovation is urgently needed. In this connection, open-source technologies, participatory approaches and new forms of governance are becoming more popular and relevant. This theme issue looks into the tangible impacts of these technological advancements, with a focus on participatory cities. It aims to explain how digital tools are used in cities to tackle urban challenges, improve governance and promote sustainability. Through a collection of in-depth analyses, case studies and real-world examples, this issue seeks to offer a comprehensive understanding of the digital governance frameworks underpinning participatory cities. By offering a platform for multidisciplinary discourse, this theme issue endeavors to contribute to the broader narrative of shaping a more resilient, sustainable and democratic urban future in the digital age.”</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10676-024-09811-4">Procedural fairness in algorithmic decision-making: the role of public engagement</a> - Springer Nature Link, Marie Christin Decker, November 15, 2024</p><p dir="ltr">“Despite the widespread use of automated decision-making (ADM) systems, they are often developed without involving the public or those directly affected, leading to concerns about systematic biases that may perpetuate structural injustices. Existing formal fairness approaches primarily focus on statistical outcomes across demographic groups or individual fairness, yet these methods reveal ambiguities and limitations in addressing fairness comprehensively. This paper argues for a holistic approach to algorithmic fairness that integrates procedural fairness, considering both decision-making processes and their outcomes. Procedural fairness emphasizes the importance of fair decision-making procedures, which aligns with theories of relational justice that stress the quality of social relations and power dynamics. We highlight the need for substantive procedural fairness to ensure better outcomes and address forward-looking responsibilities. Additionally, we propose leveraging Public Engagement, a core dimension within the well-established Responsible Research and Innovation framework, to enhance procedural fairness in ADM systems. Our contribution underscores the value of Public Engagement in fostering fairer ADM processes, thereby expanding the current focus beyond technical outcome-based approaches to encompass broader procedural considerations.”</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0004370224001802?via%3Dihub">Human-AI coevolution</a> - ScienceDirect, February 2024</p><p dir="ltr">“Human-AI coevolution, defined as a process in which humans and AI algorithms continuously influence each other, increasingly characterizes our society, but is understudied in artificial intelligence and complexity science literature. Recommender systems and assistants play a prominent role in human-AI coevolution, as they permeate many facets of daily life and influence human choices through online platforms. The interaction between users and AI results in a potentially endless feedback loop, wherein users' choices generate data to train AI models, which, in turn, shape subsequent user preferences. This human-AI feedback loop has peculiar characteristics compared to traditional human-machine interaction and gives rise to complex and often “unintended” systemic outcomes. This paper introduces human-AI coevolution as the cornerstone for a new field of study at the intersection between AI and complexity science focused on the theoretical, empirical, and mathematical investigation of the human-AI feedback loop. In doing so, we: (i) outline the pros and cons of existing methodologies and highlight shortcomings and potential ways for capturing feedback loop mechanisms; (ii) propose a reflection at the intersection between complexity science, AI and society; (iii) provide real-world examples for different human-AI ecosystems; and (iv) illustrate challenges to the creation of such a field of study, conceptualizing them at increasing levels of abstraction, i.e., scientific, legal and socio-political.”</p><h2 dir="ltr">AI for Governance</h2><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.nlc.org/resource/ai-report-and-toolkit/">AI Report and Toolkit </a>- NLC 100, November 13, 2024</p><p dir="ltr">Artificial Intelligence is transforming local government by improving city services, supporting staff, and enhancing decision-making.

While employees cannot rely on such tools for work or use AI-generated outputs, they are allowed to experiment with AI models within the agency's internal testing environment through its AI Lab. The USPTO has also invested $75 million to enhance its patent database with AI-powered search features. This cautious approach reflects broader challenges in integrating AI into government operations, as seen with other agencies like NASA, which limits AI use for sensitive data while experimenting with its potential for coding and data accessibility.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://cdt.org/insights/effective-remedies-in-ai-an-insufficiently-explored-avenue-for-ai-accountability/">Effective Remedies in AI: an Insufficiently Explored Avenue for AI Accountability</a> - Center for Democracy and Technology, Laura Lazaro Cabrera, November 14, 2024</p><p dir="ltr">A recent article examines the ongoing challenges of ensuring effective remedies for individuals impacted by AI systems in the European Union. While the European Charter of Fundamental Rights guarantees the right to an effective remedy, the complexity and opacity of AI systems can make it difficult for individuals to understand how they have been affected, complicating legal recourse. The AI Act introduces important transparency measures, such as requiring providers to disclose the use of AI systems in decision-making, particularly for high-risk applications. Though its complaint mechanisms offer a step forward, the article highlights that further efforts, including the AI Liability Directive, are necessary to address procedural barriers and strengthen access to remedies. As AI continues to play a larger role in daily life, the article stresses the need for comprehensive legal frameworks that ensure AI accountability and protect individuals' rights across the EU.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.dhs.gov/news/2024/11/14/groundbreaking-framework-safe-and-secure-deployment-ai-critical-infrastructure">Groundbreaking Framework for the Safe and Secure Deployment of AI in Critical Infrastructure Unveiled by Department of Homeland Security</a> - Department of Homeland Security, November 14, 2024</p><p dir="ltr">The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has released the Roles and Responsibilities Framework for Artificial Intelligence in Critical Infrastructure. Developed by the DHS Artificial Intelligence Safety and Security Board, the framework offers guidelines for safely deploying AI across key sectors like energy, water, and transportation. It outlines recommendations for stakeholders, including AI developers, cloud providers, and infrastructure operators, to address risks such as cyberattacks, design flaws, and misuse. The voluntary framework aims to enhance AI security and collaboration across public and private sectors, promoting responsible AI integration without imposing regulatory requirements.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://fedscoop.com/house-bill-ai-fraud-deterrence-lieu-kiley/">California lawmakers target AI-fueled fraud in new House bill</a> - FedScoop, Matt Bricken, November 15, 2024</p><p dir="ltr">A bipartisan pair of House lawmakers is introducing legislation to address the growing threat of AI-driven fraud. The "AI Fraud Deterrence Act," introduced by California Reps. Ted Lieu (D) and Kevin Kiley (R), aims to impose harsher penalties on individuals who use artificial intelligence to commit wire fraud, mail fraud, bank fraud, or money laundering. The bill specifically targets AI’s role in enhancing fraudulent activities, proposing to raise fines for AI-related bank fraud from $1 million to $2 million, and for AI-assisted money laundering from $500,000 to $1 million, or up to three times the value of the property involved. Penalties for wire and mail fraud would also increase from $250,000 to $1 million if AI tools are used to perpetrate the crime. In cases where fraud involves disaster aid or financial institutions, the bill would double existing penalties to $2 million, irrespective of AI involvement. The lawmakers argue that by increasing penalties for AI-fueled fraud, the bill seeks to curb the misuse of rapidly advancing AI technologies, ensuring they are used responsibly while protecting individuals and institutions from emerging threats.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.insideglobaltech.com/2024/11/13/texas-legislature-to-consider-sweeping-ai-legislation-in-2025/">Texas Legislature to Consider Sweeping AI Legislation in 2025 </a>- Covington, By Matthew Shapanka, Jayne Ponder and August Gweon, November 13, 2024</p><p dir="ltr">Texas Representative Giovanni Capriglione has introduced a draft of the Texas Responsible AI Governance Act (TRAIGA), aiming to regulate "high-risk AI systems" with a focus on consumer protection and risk management. Modeled after Colorado's AI Act and the EU AI Act, TRAIGA includes stricter thresholds for defining high-risk systems, bans on AI systems with "unacceptable risks," and requirements for distributors to prevent algorithmic discrimination. Unique provisions include mandatory record-keeping for generative AI developers, expanded reporting obligations for deployers, and exemptions for small businesses, research, and open-source developers. TRAIGA would also create an AI Regulatory Sandbox Program, a workforce grant initiative, and an advisory AI Council, while authorizing enforcement by the Texas Attorney General. If passed, TRAIGA could serve as a national model for risk-based AI regulation, though it faces potential amendments and uncertain prospects in the upcoming 2025 legislative session.</p><h2 dir="ltr">AI and IR</h2><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/us-government-commission-pushes-manhattan-project-style-ai-initiative-2024-11-19/">US government commission pushes Manhattan Project-style AI initiative</a> - Reuters, By Anna Tong and Michael Martina, November 19, 2024</p><p dir="ltr">The U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission (USCC) has proposed a Manhattan Project-style initiative to develop artificial general intelligence (AGI) to compete with China's advancements in AI. Highlighting the importance of public-private partnerships, the report emphasizes the need for strategic government involvement without detailing specific investment strategies. Commissioner Jacob Helberg noted that addressing energy infrastructure bottlenecks, such as streamlining permits for data centers, could accelerate AI progress. In addition to AI, the USCC's annual report recommends tightening trade regulations, including ending the de minimis trade exemption, which allows duty-free entry for low-value Chinese goods, and imposing stricter controls on Chinese involvement in U.S. biotechnology. However, implementing these recommendations faces challenges, such as bipartisan disagreements and resistance from the shipping industry and trade groups concerned about e-commerce disruption.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/war-and-peace-age-artificial-intelligence">War and Peace in the Age of Artificial Intelligence</a> - Foreign Affairs, By Henry A. Kissinger, Eric Schmidt, and Craig Mundie, November 18, 2024</p><p dir="ltr">AI is poised to reshape warfare, diplomacy, and global power dynamics, offering precision and speed but raising ethical and existential concerns. It could escalate conflicts by targeting digital infrastructure, fueling secrecy and paranoia among nations racing for dominance, or disrupting traditional nation-state authority as corporations and decentralized groups gain influence. While AI’s objectivity might enable better governance and conflict resolution, its lack of human restraint risks spiraling into destructive scenarios. The challenge lies in balancing AI’s potential to solve complex problems with preserving human agency and avoiding over-reliance on technology that could destabilize global order.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.weforum.org/stories/2024/11/what-is-sovereign-ai-and-why-is-the-concept-so-appealing-and-fraught/">What is ‘sovereign AI’ and why is the concept so appealing (and fraught)?</a> - World Economic Forum, November 13, 2024</p><p dir="ltr">Countries are increasingly developing sovereign AI initiatives to protect their cultural identity, bolster economic competitiveness, and reduce reliance on foreign technologies. Denmark, for instance, has funded a supercomputer with revenues from weight-loss drugs to support AI-driven biotech and pharmaceutical research, while Italy, Sweden, the UAE, and India are pursuing similar projects. Sovereign AI enables nations to embed their values and priorities into technology but poses risks of "sovereignty traps" that could hinder global cooperation. High costs, geopolitical tensions over chip access, and the challenge of aligning national and global interests complicate efforts. Advocates suggest cross-border collaboration, like a Global AI Compact, to ensure equitable access to AI infrastructure, likening its importance to electricity in the modern world. However, nations must navigate tensions between codifying cultural identity and fostering inclusive global AI governance.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/treasury-outbound-investment-china-artificial-intelligence/">A US Ban on Investing in Chinese AI Startups Could Escalate Under Trump</a> - Wired, By Zeyi Yang, November 18, 2024</p><p dir="ltr">The US Treasury Department has finalized new restrictions, effective January 2025, limiting American investments in advanced Chinese AI startups for national security reasons. These rules ban funding for AI technologies tied to China's military or intelligence services and impose a threshold of 1025 flops (a measure of AI model power) to restrict investments in cutting-edge consumer AI. The move, part of broader efforts like export controls and investment scrutiny, aims to slow China's AI advancements while reinforcing US dominance. Although current impacts are modest, the regulations add due diligence burdens for US investors and could discourage Chinese startups from seeking US support. The incoming Trump administration may expand these measures further, with Republican China hawks advocating tougher restrictions on other sectors like biotech and batteries.</p></div><!----></div><div
