Since Canada became the first country to announce a national AI strategy in 2017 and then led G7 adoption of a “common vision for the future of artificial intelligence” in 2018, at least 70 countries have developed AI strategies, almost every multilateral organization also has adopted a policy statement on AI, and the Council of Europe identifies some 450 AI governance initiatives from a wide variety of stakeholders. This worldwide flurry reflects how much generative AI models and the explosive uptake of ChatGPT have captured mainstream attention.Now, the United Nations (UN) aims to impose order on this expanding landscape. Secretary General António Guterres—a prominent voice in calling for a global body to govern perceived existential risks of emerging foundational AI models—initiated a global digital compact to be finalized alongside this September’s UN General Assembly.”&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/us-britain-eu-sign-agreement-ai-standards-ft-reports-2024-09-05/">US, Britain, EU to sign first international AI treaty</a> –<strong> </strong>Reuters, September 5, 2024</p><ul><li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"><p dir="ltr" role="presentation">“The first legally binding international AI treaty will be open for signing on Thursday by the countries that negotiated it, including European Union members, the United States and Britain, the Council of Europe human rights organization said.The AI Convention, which has been in the works for years and was adopted in May after discussions between 57 countries, addresses the risks AI may pose, while promoting responsible innovation”</p></li></ul><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://fedscoop.com/federal-agencies-law-enforcement-ai-field-testing-checklist/">Law enforcement agencies need standardized AI field testing, presidential advisers say</a> –<strong> </strong>Fedscoop, by Matt Bracken, September 4, 2024</p><ul><li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"><p dir="ltr" role="presentation">“Though President Joe Biden’s AI executive order “explicitly requires real-world testing” of AI tools, Bambauer said there wasn’t a “standardized approach to testing AI” in federal policing.

Bambauer and her colleagues then went on a fact-finding mission with local law enforcement to find out how big a lift field testing might be. In a visit with the Miami Police Department — where subcommittee member Armando Aguilar serves as assistant chief — Bambauer said she expected to find a skeptical force concerned with too many testing protocols gumming up their work.”</p></li></ul><h2 dir="ltr">AI and Elections<strong id="docs-internal-guid-767d77dd-7fff-9818-5418-8900f7e79d44"></strong></h2><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/09/03/1103464/ai-impact-elections-overblown/">AI’s impact on elections is being overblown</a> – MIT Technology Review, by Felix M.

Commenting on the upcoming US election, Meta’s latest Adversarial Threat Report acknowledged that AI was being used to meddle—for example, by Russia-based operations—but that “GenAI-powered tactics provide only incremental productivity and content-generation gains” to such “threat actors.” This echoes comments from the company’s president of global affairs, Nick Clegg, who earlier this year stated that “it is striking how little these tools have been used on a systematic basis to really try to subvert and disrupt the elections.”&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://apnews.com/article/california-ai-election-deepfakes-safety-regulations-eb6bbc80e346744dbb250f931ebca9f3">California lawmakers approve legislation to ban deepfakes related to elections</a>&nbsp;–<strong> </strong>AP, by Tran Nguyen, September 1, 2024</p><ul><li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"><p dir="ltr" role="presentation">“Lawmakers approved legislation to ban deepfakes related to elections and require large social media platforms to remove the deceptive material 120 days before Election Day and 60 days thereafter.

"We decided to use artificial intelligence to be the 'face' of the information we're publishing," Huertas said in an interview, "because our colleagues who are still out doing their jobs are facing much more risk." At least 10 journalists have been arrested since mid-June and eight remain imprisoned on charges including terrorism, according to Reporters Without Borders. "Here, using artificial intelligence is... almost like a mix between technology and journalism," Huertas said, explaining the project looked to "circumvent the persecution and increasing repression" from the government as there would be no one who could face arrest.”</p></li></ul><p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><a href="https://news.iu.edu/live/news/37791-75-million-grant-to-guard-against-ai-driven">$7.5 million grant to guard against AI-driven misinformation</a> –<strong> </strong>News at IU, by Kevin Fryling, September 4, 2024</p><ul><li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"><p dir="ltr" role="presentation">“Indiana University researchers will lead a multi-institutional team of experts in areas such as informatics, psychology, communications and folklore to assess the role that artificial intelligence may play in strengthening the influence of online communications — including misinformation and radicalizing messages — under a $7.5 million grant from the U.S. Department of Defense.

This isn't an exaggeration – AI is driving decades of progress in just a few years. As AI continues to evolve, it's essential that its growth remains responsible and ethical. However, there are sectors like agriculture and food that stand to benefit immensely from this AI-driven paradigm shift. The impact of AI on these industries is not just transformative; it's revolutionary. AI-enabled food systems are having profound effects on our society, economy, environment and humanity at large.
