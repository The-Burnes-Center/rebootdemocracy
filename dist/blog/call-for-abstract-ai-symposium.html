My takeaway on the opinion: the ABA is recognizing the benefits of GAI but is requiring lawyers to: 1) Obtain truly informed consent from the client, explaining all the risks involved, 2) Ensure no confidential information is input into a GAI system, 3)Thoroughly verify all outputs for accuracy, and 4) Use GAI for general tasks that don't involve specific client information."><meta property="og:title" content="RebootDemocracy.AI Blog | Using AI?

With these changes come obvious threats; among the most profound is their potential to undermine democratic freedoms —including at least the civil and political liberties that democracies protect, and the basic right to stable and functioning democratic institutions….Through an initial closed-door work-in-progress workshop, and a subsequent public event to launch the resulting papers and to engage stakeholders, we will galvanize this emerging field, providing a resource and leadership to researchers and policymakers alike.”&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p dir="ltr">The call for abstracts is open through this Friday, September 20th.
