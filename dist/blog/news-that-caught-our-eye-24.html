It starts with a recognition that, on technology, governments and public-interest organizations don't have to be relegated to the role of rule-makers. They can be inventors, builders, market- shapers, and maintainers. We believe the collective enterprise of building public AI infrastructure can kick-start a virtuous cycle, aligning the goals of the public with public investment and delivering the benefits of AI advances to all. The result is a new political economy.”</p></li></ul><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.popvox.org/futureproofing">Future-Proofing Congress: How Member-Led Upgrades Are Optimizing Legislative Branch Capacity and Resilience</a> – Popvox Foundation, August 2024</p><ul><li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"><p dir="ltr" role="presentation">“The House of Representatives is in the midst of a modernization golden age that began in 2019.

Traditional economic forecasting methods, such as econometric models and consensus forecasts, often face limitations like data scarcity, limited predictive accuracy, and difficulty adapting to rapidly changing economic conditions. AI integration offers enhanced capabilities, including real-time updates and improved handling of complex data sets through techniques like machine learning and neural networks. This shift significantly improves prediction accuracy and economic policy strategy adaptability.”</p></li></ul><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.06292">The AI Scientist: Towards Fully Automated Open-Ended Scientific Discovery</a> – By Chris Lu, Cong Lu, Robert Tjarko Lange et al., August 13, 2024</p><ul><li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"><p dir="ltr" role="presentation">“One of the grand challenges of artificial general intelligence is developing agents capable of conducting scientific research and discovering new knowledge. While frontier models have already been used as aids to human scientists, e.g. for brainstorming ideas, writing code, or prediction tasks, they still conduct only a small part of the scientific process. This paper presents the first comprehensive framework for fully automatic scientific discovery, enabling frontier large language models (LLMs) to perform research independently and communicate their findings. We introduce The AI Scientist, which generates novel research ideas, writes code, executes experiments, visualizes results, describes its findings by writing a full scientific paper, and then runs a simulated review process for evaluation. In principle, this process can be repeated to iteratively develop ideas in an open-ended fashion and add them to a growing archive of knowledge, acting like the human scientific community.”</p></li></ul><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://docsend.com/view/ity6yf2dansesucf#">Predicting Results of Social Science Experiments Using Large Language Models</a> – By Ashwini Ashokkumar, Luke Hewitt, Isaias Ghezae, Robb Willer, August 8, 2024</p><ul><li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"><p dir="ltr" role="presentation">“To evaluate whether large language models (LLMs) can be leveraged to predict the results of social science experiments, we built an archive of 70 pre-registered, nationally representative, survey experiments conducted in the United States, involving 476 experimental treatment effects and 105,165 participants. We prompted an advanced, publicly-available LLM (GPT-4) to simulate how representative samples of Americans would respond to the stimuli from these experiments. Predictions derived from simulated responses correlate strikingly with actual treatment effects (r = 0.85), equaling or surpassing the predictive accuracy of human forecasters. Accuracy remained high for unpublished studies that could not appear in the model’s training data (r = 0.90).”&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3737/paper40.pdf">Digital Government in Japan: Historical Foundations, Future Ambitions, and the Digital Agency </a>– By Sara Takamatsu, Masaki Wakao, Dr. Takuo Inoue, et al., Proceedings EGOV-CeDEM-ePart conference, September 1-5, 2024, Ghent University and KU Leuven,&nbsp;Ghent/Leuven, Belgium</p><ul><li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"><p dir="ltr" role="presentation">“Japan has always played a leading role in technological innovation, but when it comes to research on Japan’s digital government, there is a noticeable absence of literature.

The accusations, false as they are, prey on widespread fears and misunderstandings over the trustworthiness of online information in the AI age. It would be nice to think that we could just say Trump's claims here are categorically false and leave it at that. But as artificial intelligence tools become increasingly good at generating photorealistic images, it's worth outlining the many specific ways we can tell that Harris' crowd photos are indeed authentic. Consider this a guide for potential techniques you can use the next time you come across accusations that some online image has been ‘A.I.'d’ to fool you.”</p></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>
