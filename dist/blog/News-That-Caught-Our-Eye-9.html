The time-saving potential alone is worth the investment. Particularly, researchers studied government transactions that are a simple exchange of information, followed by a decision: registering to vote, applying for a license, etc.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h3 dir="ltr">Despite appearances, Congress is quietly improving functionality</h3><p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-a1b99a16-7fff-efc7-bc6e-3e92d8a48ea6"><a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/4549766-despite-appearances-congress-is-quietly-improving-functionality/">The Hill</a> (March 23, 2024)</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Rodney Davis and Ed Perlmutter, opinion contributors for The Hill, observe the quiet updates in the House to improve transparency to the American people and prepare to “hold a runaway executive branch accountable” ahead of the 2024 election.
