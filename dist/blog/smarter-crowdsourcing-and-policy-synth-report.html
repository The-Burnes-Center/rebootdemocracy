By integrating AI capabilities into this participatory process, Policy Synth aims to make the Smarter Crowdsourcing method more efficient, effective, and scalable, enabling institutions to develop solutions more rapidly than would be possible with human intelligence alone.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Finally, we describe a case study comparing solutions to a complex policy problem generated using artificial intelligence to those developed through expert crowdsourcing. The case study demonstrates how generative AI can make participatory problem-solving with human participants more effective because the tools make it possible to translate ideas into implementable proposals more quickly than human participation alone.</p><p dir="ltr">Though many AI toolkits exist, they too often are not fitted to the needs of institutions and policymakers. Further, while many existing approaches view AI as a tool to make crowdsourcing and deliberative processes better and more efficient, Policy Synth goes a step further, recognizing that AI can also be used to synthesize the findings from engagements together with research to develop evidence-based solutions and policies.</p><p dir="ltr">The report is aimed at policymakers, scholars in the fields of artificial intelligence and collective intelligence, and the civic community, particularly, those who are interested in learning more about the power of open source software, GPT agents, and large language models (LLMs).&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Using Artificial Intelligence to Accelerate Collective Intelligence, by <a href="https://burnes.northeastern.edu/people/robert-bjarnason/">Róbert Bjarnason</a>, <a href="https://burnes.northeastern.edu/people/dane-gambrell/">Dane Gambrell,</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshua-lanthier-welch-2235681/">Joshua Lanthier-Welch</a>, is available for free download <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VaCgDcGdYaRkLgdr6C-6BQFdoGyqWQ1U/view">here</a>.
