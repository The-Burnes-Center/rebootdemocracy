It emphasizes the need for cross-functional collaboration, involving multiple departments in the acquisition process, and mandates the integration of AI-specific risk management, particularly regarding privacy, security, data ownership, and interoperability. Agencies are instructed to foster competition and avoid vendor lock-in, ensure transparency in the acquisition of rights-impacting AI, and adopt innovative procurement practices. The memorandum also highlights the importance of training acquisition teams to manage AI risks effectively and promotes accountability in the use of generative AI and biometric systems.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://en.agcm.it/dotcmsdoc/pressrelease/G7%202024%20-%20Digital%20Competition%20Communiqu%C3%A9.pdf">G7 Competition Authorities and Policymakers’ Summit</a> - October 4, 2024</p><p dir="ltr">The Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division participated in the G7 Competition Authorities and Policymakers Summit to discuss ways to ensure competition in artificial intelligence (AI)-related technologies, products, and applications. At the conclusion of the summit, FTC Chair Lina M. Khan and other representatives of the G7 competition authorities and government policymakers issued a Communiqué highlighting potential competition concerns in AI-related markets and identifying guiding principles to ensure fair competition across AI markets. The Communiqué underscores the important role that competition authorities and policymakers have in addressing competitive threats. As the Communiqué outlines, concentrated market power in AI-related markets and possible collusion or improper information sharing using AI technologies require careful vigilance and vigorous and timely competition enforcement. The G7 competition authorities and policymakers reaffirmed that they are working to ensure there is open and fair competition in digital markets and AI and seeking to ensure that the benefits of AI are fully realized and widely available across society.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://fedscoop.com/va-rfi-ai-governance-framework/">VA seeks information on AI governance framework</a> - FedScoop, Caroline Nihill, October 8, 2024</p><p dir="ltr">“The Department of Veterans Affairs is seeking expertise from the public regarding the implementation of a framework for artificial intelligence governance and mitigating the technology’s risks. The request for information, published last week, is part of an overarching goal to implement AI across the VA. The RFI notes that the agency seeks to minimize safety risks that involve privacy while leveraging the technology to enhance services and care to veterans. That ‘proactive approach,’ the VA says, is aimed at preventing potential issues and ‘establishing a robust, responsive governance structure that includes policies, processes and guidance to address and resolve problems that may arise.’”</p><p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202410/colorado-legislators-wrangle-laws-on-facial-recognition-in-schools-data-protection">Colorado legislators wrangle laws on facial recognition in schools, data protection</a> - Biometric, By Joel R. McConvey, October 10, 2024</p><p dir="ltr">In Colorado, a moratorium on AI facial recognition cameras in schools is set to expire in July 2025, which could lead to increased use of this technology. The moratorium was enacted in 2022 to pause new contracts for AI facial recognition in public and charter schools while a body examined biometric technology usage. Schools using AI facial recognition before the moratorium, such as the Cheyenne Mountain School District, were allowed to continue. The debate balances the potential benefits for emergency response, especially in a state with a history of gun violence, against concerns about privacy and over-surveillance. At the same time, Colorado has passed HB24-1468, a law that establishes a task force to assess the impact of AI and biometric technologies, including facial recognition, with a focus on ethical and equitable considerations. Additionally, a new amendment to the Colorado Privacy Act (CPA), effective in July 2025, introduces stricter regulations on biometric data, drawing comparisons to Illinois' Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA). This new regulation could further shape the state's approach to AI and biometrics.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gzeromedia.com/gzero-ai/south-korea-banned-deepfakes-is-that-a-realistic-solution-for-the-us">South Korea banned deepfakes. Is that a realistic solution for the US?</a> - Gzero Media, By Scott Nover, October 8, 2024</p><p dir="ltr">On September 26, South Korea strengthened its law against deepfake pornography, making it illegal not only to create and distribute but also to view such content. Violators could face up to three years in jail or a $22,000 fine. Deepfakes, created by superimposing someone's face onto explicit material without consent, have affected both celebrities and private individuals. South Korea's aggressive approach contrasts with the U.S., where legal responses to deepfakes are inconsistent across states. While some laws exist, full prohibition would likely violate First Amendment protections. Experts acknowledge the need for regulation but note enforcement challenges and legal hurdles.</p><h4 dir="ltr">&nbsp;</h4><h4 dir="ltr">AI for Governance</h4><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://techpoint.africa/2024/10/12/kenya-opens-africas-ai-skilling/">Kenya opens Africa’s AI skilling centre with support from UNDP and Microsoft </a>- Tech Point, By Abdullah Ajibade, October 12, 2024</p><p dir="ltr">Kenya, in partnership with UNDP and Microsoft, has launched the Africa Centre of Competence for Digital and AI Skills at the Kenya School of Government in Nairobi.
