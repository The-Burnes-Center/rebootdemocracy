Emerging technologies, particularly Artificial Intelligence (AI), have become integral tools that everyone, including&nbsp; public servants, will need to leverage in order to improve efficiencies across business and government alike. Recognizing the urgency of this moment, President Biden's <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/10/30/executive-order-on-the-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-development-and-use-of-artificial-intelligence/">Executive Order</a> on Artificial Intelligence has underscored the opportunity ahead of us: to train public servants in the responsible use of AI to best be able to service their constituents using top of the line technology.</p><p dir="ltr">The Executive Order aptly calls upon agencies to "increase the availability and use of AI training and familiarization programs for employees, managers, and leadership." It highlights the critical need for public professionals to comprehend the intricacies of AI, its responsible application, and its associated risks. While there is an abundance of free AI content available online, including courses on Udemy and Coursera, the government requires tailored training designed specifically for its unique needs.</p><p dir="ltr">InnovateUS is pioneering training for public sector professionals, designed and implemented by individuals who understand the public sector's nuances. InnovateUS employs cutting-edge technology to make learning more accessible and scalable, ensuring that public servants can access high-quality training regardless of their location or role within the government. To support InnovateUS in this mission, Google.org has <a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/google-org/google-org-innovate-us-funding-support/">committed $2 million</a> to expand the reach of its free AI training programs to 50,000 learners over the next three years.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">What makes this initiative truly exceptional is the range of topics covered by the training programs. Live workshops, featuring luminaries like Santiago Garces, CIO of Boston, teaching generative AI policy writing, and Chris Rein, CTO of New Jersey, educating on responsible AI procurement, underscore the real-world relevance of the training. Jennifer Anastasoff and Cassandra Madison, leading figures from the Tech Talent Project, delve into the crucial subject of bringing AI talent into government service.</p><p dir="ltr">The need for public servants to comprehend the capabilities of these transformative technologies cannot be overstated. AI has the potential to simplify language, aid in research, and modernize legacy code, among many other applications. However, responsible governance with AI necessitates examples and case studies tailored to the public sector's unique requirements. It is essential for public servants to understand how these technologies can serve the public interest effectively and responsibly.</p><p dir="ltr">In a world where AI is underpinning virtually every technological advancement, every government official, regardless of their role or background, must acquire a foundational understanding of these technologies, their potential, and their ethical implications. Google.org and InnovateUS are meeting the moment in ensuring that the public sector is equipped to leverage AI to its fullest potential while safeguarding the interests of the citizens it serves.</p><p dir="ltr">This work is a testament to our collective commitment to empowering public servants and ensuring that they are well-prepared to meet the demands of an AI-driven future while remaining steadfastly dedicated to serving the public good. In this transformative moment, it is organizations like InnovateUS that will shape the future of governance and propel us toward a more efficient, responsive, and responsible government.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>
