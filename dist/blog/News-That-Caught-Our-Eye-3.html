The Library of Congress is working with the Congressional Research Service, leveraging AI to assist analysts in creating high-quality summaries of pending bills for Congress.gov. However, there is so much more that Congress could and should be doing with AI to improve the quality of lawmaking.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h3 dir="ltr">Wait, did he really say that?
