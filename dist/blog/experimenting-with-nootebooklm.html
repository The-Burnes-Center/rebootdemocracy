The model later admitted these were speculative, not fact-based.&nbsp;This example highlights a key limitation: while NotebookLM is powerful, users must carefully verify the accuracy of its outputs, especially for public content.</p><p>We've posted the AI-generated audio transcription as we usually do and also added the podcast here and on the News that Caught our Eye.</p><p><audio controls="controls"><source src="https://content.thegovlab.com/assets/e0e15940-0ddf-410d-8507-bbf810dc6857" type="audio/mpeg"></audio></p><p>Which do you prefer?</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>
