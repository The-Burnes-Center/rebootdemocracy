First, Congress should ban the use of deepfakes in ads featuring candidates or election workers. There is no place in our democracy for outright lies and manipulation about our elections. While the First Amendment protects free expression, it does not protect fraudulent speech. Second, Congress should require disclaimers on political ads appearing in any medium, which inform viewers when the ad’s content has been materially created, altered or disseminated with AI. Disclaimers on the face of a communication will put voters on notice that something they are seeing or hearing has been altered, giving them the opportunity to investigate the changes, or at least treat the message with the required degree of skepticism.”</p><p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p><h2 dir="ltr">AI and Lawmaking</h2><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://fedscoop.com/house-announces-ai-policy-establishing-guardrails-approval-process/">House announces new AI policy establishing guardrails, approval process</a> - Fedscoop, By Madison Alder, September 19, 2024</p><p dir="ltr">“The Committee on House Administration and Office of the Chief Administrative Officer announced the implementation of a new House-wide policy Thursday for the safe deployment of artificial intelligence tools by member and institutional offices. That policy, which was not released in full, ‘provides a framework for the expanded use of AI in the House,’ according to an overview from the CAO. It also establishes guardrails and principles to guide members and offices and includes a process by which the Administration Committee — known as CHA— and CAO will approve AI tools for use cases. Implementation of the policy comes as there’s been some, though seemingly limited, experimentation with the AI-based tools by lawmakers’ offices in both chambers. Similar to guidance established by executive agencies, the policy appears to strike a balance between permitting uses that could bring efficiencies while ensuring those uses are safe, responsible and secure.”</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.techpolicy.press/could-congress-leverage-ai-to-help-restore-faith-in-us-democracy/">Could Congress Leverage AI to Help Restore Faith in US Democracy?</a> - TechPolicy.Press, By Lorelei Kelly, September 17, 2024</p><p dir="ltr">“In an era of low trust and extreme social polarization, a people-centered First Branch LLM could help restore legitimacy to democratic government.

It is a cycle in which AI models are released, followed by deepfake disruption algorithms to mitigate risk, and then the creation of new AI models. The rise of big data is a major factor in why AI is evolving at the rate it is today, Bargal said. When the artificial neuron was first introduced decades ago, large-scale data sets were not readily available as they are now. To effectively make AI-powered systems work in government, agencies need to know what data is being input into them and ensure that it accurately represents the population being served, said Grant Fergusson, Equal Justice Works fellow and counsel at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, during a session.”</p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2 dir="ltr">AI and Public Engagement</h2><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://medium.com/urban-ai/mapping-ai-narratives-at-the-local-level-db19e46608cd">Mapping AI Narratives at the Local Level</a> - Medium, By Urban AI, September 20, 2024</p><p dir="ltr">This year-long project is designed to curate the organization of events dedicated to artificial intelligence (AI) across the territory.
