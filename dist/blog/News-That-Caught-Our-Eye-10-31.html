Seven major jurisdictions, including the US, UK, Japan, and EU, have established or are developing AISIs. A new report compares these institutes, highlighting three main characteristics of the first wave: a focus on safety, government leadership, and technical expertise. These institutes conduct research, set safety standards, and promote international cooperation. AISIs are focused on safety evaluations and best practices but lack regulatory authority. Some critics argue their narrow focus on safety could hinder innovation or duplicate existing efforts. Future AISIs in developing countries may emphasize innovation alongside safety, potentially adopting different governance models.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/3284120/hong-kong-unveils-rules-responsible-ai-use-it-gets-ahead-disruptive-technology">Hong Kong unveils rules for ‘responsible’ AI use as it gets ahead of disruptive technology</a> - South China Morning Post, By Mia Castagnone, October 27, 2024</p><p dir="ltr">Hong Kong has launched its first guidelines for responsible AI use and is supporting blockchain technology to keep up with fintech advancements. Financial Secretary Paul Chan said AI is a key focus and asked financial institutions to create plans for using it safely, including offering training. Hong Kong wants to be a link between international businesses and China, promoting AI while addressing risks like fraud and cyberattacks. A new payment system between Hong Kong and mainland China is set for 2025.

Who will set the guardrails in the public interest and provide the clarity that all markets need to thrive?&nbsp;Right now, Big Tech is the only voice in the room. In 2022, the top five technology companies with the largest lobbying presence spent a combined $76 million on lobbying efforts alone, according to a Responsible Innovation Labs analysis of OpenSecrets data. RIL also found that over the past five years, these companies spent an average of $69 million and employed an average of 92 lobbyists. From 2022 to 2023, AI lobbying increased by 185%. At the other end of the spectrum are America’s startup founders, who you’ll have to forgive if they’re not hyper focused on politics. They are working right now to build the next great American companies powering — and powered by — AI. They are grinding tirelessly to win. They are creating AI applications to tackle health, disaster preparedness, agriculture, and critical infrastructure, among other areas of American economic strength. In other domains, they are exploring space and working toward energy security. For AI regulation — and tech policy — to work, American startup founders need to be at the table.”</p><p><strong><br><br></strong></p><h4 dir="ltr">AI and Problem Solving</h4><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-africa/africas-digital-decade/">Africa’s digital decade: AI upskilling and expanding speech technology</a> - The Keyword, Matt Brittin, October 28, 2024</p><p dir="ltr">Google has announced the integration of 15 African languages into Voice Search, Gboard, and Google Translate, enabling around 300 million more people to use their voices to interact with technology.

Commuters descending to the A and B subway lines (formally known as the Blue and Red lines) will enter into the testing ground for Metro's 30-day pilot program, which is set to go into effect Wednesday. The program arrives amid growing concern over passenger safety, with Metro recording an uptick in arrests this year for riders carrying concealed weapons. The roughly 6-foot-tall Evolv Technology scanners use artificial intelligence to pinpoint on a person's body where they could possibly be carrying a weapon, according to the company's website. All weapons are banned on the Metro system, and it is illegal to carry a concealed firearm without a permit in California.”<a href="https://fedscoop.com/energy-department-is-looking-at-using-ai-to-help-with-its-nuclear-accelerators/">Energy Department is looking at using AI to help with its nuclear accelerators</a> - Fedscoop, Rebecca Heilweil, October 25, 2024</p><p dir="ltr">“The nuclear physics program in the Energy Department’s Science Office wants to use artificial intelligence to help control its advanced accelerators, according to a new solicitation posted to the agency’s website.

Tutors and students type messages to one another through a chat interface, and a tutor who needs help explaining how and why a student went wrong can press a button to generate suggestions from Tutor CoPilot. The researchers created the model by training GPT-4 on a database of 700 real tutoring sessions in which experienced teachers worked on on one with first- to fifth-grade students on math lessons, identifying the students’ errors and then working with them to correct the errors in such a way that they learned to understand the broader concepts being taught. From this, the model generates responses that tutors can customize to help their online students.”</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>
