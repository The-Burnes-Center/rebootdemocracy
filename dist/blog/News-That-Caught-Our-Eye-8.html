The total of $400,000 in civil penalties is really the first significant example we’ve seen of the SEC's strategy to protect investors from misleading claims about AI.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h3 dir="ltr">AI Is the Latest Tool in W.Va.'s Fight Against Opioid Use</h3><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.govtech.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-is-the-latest-tool-in-w-va-s-fight-against-opioid-use">GovTech</a> (March 15, 2024)</p><p dir="ltr">West Virginia has announced a partnership with health tech firm GATC, investing $5 million to integrate AI into pharmaceutical research for tackling opioid use disorder. AI will be used to speed up the analysis of genetic data and reduce the duration and cost of preclinical trials, with hopes to accelerate the development of a non-opioid, non-habit-forming drug candidate. This is just another example of how AI can boost efficiency in public-facing services, for the good.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h3 dir="ltr">India drops plan to require approval for AI model launches</h3><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/15/india-drops-plan-to-require-approval-for-ai-model-launches/?utm_source=www.theneurondaily.com&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=ai-expectations-vs-reality&amp;guccounter=1">TechCrunch</a> (March 15, 2024)</p><p dir="ltr">Whoops! India just reversed its plan (announced just two weeks ago) to require government approval for AI model launches, after facing significant backlash from both local and global entrepreneurs and investors. Now, the Ministry of Electronics and IT will simply require developers to label under-tested or unreliable AI models, rather than seek pre-approval and stifle innovation opportunities.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h3 dir="ltr">China said to fall short of matching US advances in AI owing to ‘many challenges in theory and technologies’</h3><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3255545/china-said-fall-short-matching-us-advances-ai-owing-many-challenges-theory-and-technologies?utm_source=www.theneurondaily.com&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=ai-expectations-vs-reality">South China Morning Post</a> (March 15, 2024)</p><p dir="ltr">A presentation made to Chinese Premier Li Qiang revealed that China faces significant challenges in theory &amp; technology that are hindering its ability to keep pace with the United States' advancements in AI. Specific issues highlighted include reliance on foreign systems like Meta’s Llama for model development and computing infrastructure limitations for training. Politicians and entrepreneurs alike are calling for decisive measures to prevent the gap from widening any further.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h3 dir="ltr">Not Everyone Thinks AI Is Going To Destroy Us: “super forecasters” share their views&nbsp;</h3><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/artificial-intelligence/2024/not-everyone-thinks-ai-is-going-to-kill-us/">PYMNTS</a> (March 14, 2024)</p><p dir="ltr">A report from the Forecasting Research Institute shows that AI experts are generally more concerned about AI's risks than top-notch predictors called “super forecasters,” who hold a more tempered view of the technology. The study placed AI optimists and pessimists in conversation with one another to examine the social dynamics of opinion-sharing on AI. For example, ClearSale’s Bruno Farinelli argued that AI pessimism “often results from underestimating human ingenuity and misunderstanding the capabilities of current AI systems,” while RebootDemocracy’s own Beth Simone Noveck noted that AI’s power should not distract from “addressing how to use these tools right now to address very urgent problems like inequality, climate change, racial justice and more.”</p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h3 dir="ltr">OpenAI Inks Deals With European Publishers Le Monde, Prisa</h3><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-13/openai-inks-deals-with-european-publishers-le-monde-prisa?embedded-checkout=true&amp;utm_source=www.theneurondaily.com&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=humanoid-robots">Bloomberg</a> (March 13, 2024)</p><p dir="ltr">OpenAI has secured licensing agreements with European publishers Le Monde and Prisa Media, aiming to integrate French and Spanish language news content into ChatGPT. Following the company’s similar licensing deals with AP and Axel Springer, it’s clear that OpenAI is focused on expanding ChatGPT's reach &amp; utility in delivering news to a global audience – though it remains to be seen how much non-participating publications can handle the squeeze.</p><p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p><h3 dir="ltr">The EU AI Act passed — here’s what comes next</h3><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/14/24001919/eu-ai-act-foundation-models-regulation-data">The Verge</a> (March 13, 2024)</p><p dir="ltr">The European Union has officially approved the AI Act to regulate the use of artificial intelligence technologies, banning the highest-risk uses and demanding transparency from AI providers. After some compromises, such as softening the ban on biometric surveillance and limiting fines on open-source developers, the Act will be enforced in stages and impose different rules on general-purpose (think ChatGPT) versus specific-use systems. The Act’s requirement to disclose underlying training data may significantly impact copyright lawsuits in the United States. The new framework claims to balance innovation opportunities with the protection of citizens' rights. Check out the European Commission’s website for an explainer of the Act.</p><p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p><h3 dir="ltr">House AI Task Force Holds First Meeting, Rep. Beyer Keys on Goals</h3><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.meritalk.com/articles/house-ai-task-force-holds-first-meeting-rep-beyer-keys-on-goals/">MeriTalk</a> (March 12, 2024)</p><p dir="ltr">Rep. Beyer shared his personal vision for the House AI Task Force, focusing on three main areas: boosting AI innovation, securing federal funding for AI initiatives, and enhancing transparency within the tech sector. They have a sea of over 200 proposed bills to dive into and, from which, identify the best legislation. It’s clear there’s excitement among lawmakers about the potential to guide the country to leadership position in the global AI race.</p><p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p><h3 dir="ltr">Google won’t let you use its Gemini AI to answer questions about an upcoming election in your country</h3><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/12/google-gemini-election-related-queries/">TechCrunch</a> (March 12, 2024)</p><p dir="ltr">Google's restrictions on Gemini regarding election-related queries result in the chatbot deferring questions about political parties, candidates, or politicians with a standard response, instead instructing users to try Google Search instead. While well-intentioned to prevent misinformation, this move might inadvertently hinder the ability of certain members of the public to access timely election information. Access to diverse sources of information is crucial for voters to make informed decisions, and responsibly-developed AI can play a significant role in facilitating such access, rather than constraining it.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>
