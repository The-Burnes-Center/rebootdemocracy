The deepfake appears to superimpose Phelan’s body onto an image of Representative Hakeem Jeffries: Whether it was done with AI or Photoshop is still unknown.

For example, if there is a large wildfire in the county, there is often a major influx of calls from people reporting smoke or fire. If the county is already responding to that incident, an influx of calls can deter resources from addressing other emergencies, like heart attacks. But with machine learning, this technology can identify the location of the incident that people are likely calling about. Screening calls to ensure callers are not reporting a major event that is already being addressed will allow the county to more effectively use the time of “that finite resource, which is the human,” Brewer said.”&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1467-923X.13448">How to Build Progressive Public Services with Data Science and Artificial Intelligence</a> – The Political Quarterly, by Helen Margetts, Cosmina Dorobantu, and Jonathan Bright&nbsp; August 16, 2024</p><ul><li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"><p dir="ltr" role="presentation">“The new government faces an urgent challenge: revitalising the UK's crumbling public services without major increases in public spending.

Policymakers looking to boost AI readiness in the public sector need high quality multi-actor Information infrastructures (MAIIs) to obtain high-quality information. It is unclear which fundamental decisions can be made to shape information-sharing infrastructures for governmental purposes, even though there is some literature on these infrastructures. The main goal of this paper is to identify key variables for shaping MAIIs. Drawing on literature, expert interviews and qualitative data analysis, this paper reveals multiple variables classified into three main categories: (1) information-sharing process, systems, and services, (2) information (format), and (3) governance structures. Findings indicate that considering these variables in an early stage is needed to maximise the benefits and limit the risk of failure in shaping an MAII.”&nbsp;</p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>
