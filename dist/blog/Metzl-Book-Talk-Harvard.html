Metzl —&nbsp; Burnes Center for Social Change fellow and award-winning author — <a href="https://www.harvard.com/event/jonathan_metzl/">for a discussion on his new book</a>, <em>What We've Become: Living and Dying in a Country of Arms</em>. He was joined in conversation by Beth Simone Noveck, Director of the Burnes Center.</p><p dir="ltr">In Metzl's <em>What We’ve Become</em>, “brilliant, piercing analysis points to mass shootings as a symptom of our most unresolved national conflicts. What We’ve Become ultimately sets us on the path of alliance forging, racial reckoning, and political power brokering we must take to put things right.”</p><p dir="ltr">C-SPAN aired this event.
