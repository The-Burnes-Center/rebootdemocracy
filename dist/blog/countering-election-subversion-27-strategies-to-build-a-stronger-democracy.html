Election deniers have carried out a <a href="https://content.smartercrowdsourcing.org/assets/2b762367-1014-49c3-a20f-78108571a5a4">diverse range of election subversion strategies</a>, from spreading disinformation and conspiracy theories on social media, to advancing politicized bills in state legislatures that destabilize voting procedures, to exploiting real economic disempowerment, inequality, and government dysfunction in an effort to spread authoritarian beliefs. In many cases, these efforts have been aided by partisan media, bad-faith law firms, powerful corporations and private donors.</p><p dir="ltr">Our recommendations tackle the broader challenge of election subversion from two areas we identified through research to be high priority.</p><p dir="ltr">First, our research has shown that those seeking to undermine our democratic institutions increasingly misuse our administrative and legal systems. <strong>Election deniers <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wNQ7ff7MZXS9NuV8aurTnso4uWxSVy6HApJS_BYJPYY/edit#heading=h.805u8vt6wv2">have abused the legal system and the freedom of information system</a> in a coordinated effort to obstruct election administration and sow doubt in the outcomes of fair elections</strong> in the minds of the public. In some cases, election deniers have knowingly filed multiple malicious lawsuits with the goal of overturning electoral outcomes and canceling votes. In other cases, election deniers have filed frivolous public records requests seeking information about elections that are duplicative, repetitive, and have unreasonable and unrealistic asks, with no real purpose but to burden and strain the offices responsible for administering elections. There is a need for solutions to address malicious actors and abuse while ensuring that individuals have the ability to meaningfully exercise their due process and rights under the law.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Second, research shows that there has been an upsurge in support for violence targeting elections designed both to undermine faith in our democratic processes or to sow doubt in them. During recent election cycles, extremist groups and individuals have <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ten-vmRBEI5Bjs6DiOaRd8Xyep9a3F8NK8B0jNkO8JY/edit?usp=sharing">used violent acts and threats</a> to intimidate political opponents, disrupt electoral processes, and cast doubt on the fairness and legitimacy of election results. Local election officials, in particular, are increasingly becoming targets of harassment and violent threats. Many acts of political violence and intimidation target candidates and public servants who are women in an effort to discourage equal and diverse participation in political processes. White supremacists continue to disproportionately target communities of color – Black communities in particular – as a strategy to prevent communities from gaining and exercising equal political and economic power. <strong>There is a need for solutions to address how to better prevent, mitigate the effectiveness, and respond to violence targeting elections.&nbsp;</strong></p><p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr"><em>How We Did It</em></p><p dir="ltr">Using a problem-solving approach we call “<a href="https://smartercrowdsourcing.org/">Smarter Crowdsourcing</a>,” we co-created this set of strategies with nearly 100 experts, including representatives from community-based organizations, academics, legal practitioners, lawmakers and policymakers. We convened these experts in a series of two-hour, moderated online advisory sessions where the goal was to generate solutions that respond to these priority problems.</p><p dir="ltr">In parallel, we used an <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91001497/ai-faith-in-democracy">artificial intelligence-based toolkit</a> called <a href="https://github.com/CitizensFoundation/policy-synth">Policy Synth</a> to develop solutions. Policy Synth automated the creation of over a thousand different search queries, from general to scientific, to data-specific and news-related, to conduct a comprehensive search for problems and their root causes. Then, the software searched the web to identify solutions that are responsive to the problem. Policy Synth yielded many of the same problems and solutions as those identified by the human experts but also introduced additional solutions, such as establishing a legal defense fund for administrative officials and mental health support for election workers.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Why These Recommendations</em></p><p dir="ltr">Looking towards 2024 and future
