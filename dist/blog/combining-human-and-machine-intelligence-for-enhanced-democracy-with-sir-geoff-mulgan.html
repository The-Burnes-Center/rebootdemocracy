Mulgan discussed the challenges facing contemporary democracies and proposed innovative solutions to steer them into a more responsive and effective future.</p><p dir="ltr">Drawing on his extensive experience in government, academia, and technology, Mulgan highlighted the growing gap between the challenges faced by governments and their ability to address them. He touched upon issues such as the pandemic, climate change, and the rise of artificial intelligence, emphasizing the crucial role of intelligence, wisdom, and civic virtues in steering societies.</p><p dir="ltr">Crisis of Confidence:</p><p dir="ltr">A central concern in Mulgan's discourse was the declining confidence in democratic systems globally, as evident in surveys across generations. Millennials, in particular, show diminishing trust in democratic governance. This crisis of confidence poses a significant hurdle to effective governance, especially at a time when complex issues demand coordinated and informed decision-making.</p><p dir="ltr">Democratic Innovation:</p><p dir="ltr">To address these challenges, Mulgan advocated for a repertoire of tools and innovations rather than a singular solution. He explored the potential of AI tools in meeting design, democracy, and resident engagement. Examples from around the world, such as Taiwan's pioneering efforts in digital democracy and Austria's use of AI for climate policy, showcased the diverse applications of technology.</p><p dir="ltr">Personal Assistance and AI:</p><p dir="ltr">Mulgan emphasized the need for research and development in adapting personal AI assistants to enhance democratic processes. He envisioned AI systems that could analyze political candidates, policies, and track records to provide the public with informed choices. Despite significant investments in AI, he noted a lack of focus on utilizing these technologies to strengthen democratic practices.</p><p dir="ltr">Evidence Synthesis and Civic Platforms:</p><p dir="ltr">Large language models and evidence synthesis tools were highlighted as potential game-changers for democratic institutions. Mulgan cited examples where the public generated data on air quality, combining it with official data to shape policies. Additionally, he discussed the concept of open networks for digital commerce, where governments create meta-platforms for public services, potentially revolutionizing public policy delivery.&nbsp;</p><p><strong id="docs-internal-guid-ab8caa89-7fff-68b7-dd63-f1622623c3a7">The <a href="https://rebootdemocracy.ai/events?utm_source=Full+Mailing+List&amp;utm_campaign=75263e1715-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2023_09_12_03_37_COPY_01&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_-c37be8eaed-%5BLIST_EMAIL_ID%5D">Rebooting Democracy in the Age of AI Lecture Series</a> provides an opportunity to talk with innovative designers, thinkers, and changemakers from around the world working to “do democracy” differently. &nbsp;Sign-up to attend future conversations at rebootdemocracy.ai/events.<br><br></strong></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>
