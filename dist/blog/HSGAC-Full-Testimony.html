Governor Phil Murphy appointed me to his cabinet in 2018. Prior to that, I served as the founding Deputy Chief Technology Officer of the United States and head of the White House Open Government Initiative under President Obama. I also served as a Senior Advisor to Prime Minister Cameron at 10 Downing Street in the United Kingdom and a Member of Chancellor Angela Merkel Digital Council in Germany. I am also a professor of Experiential AI at Northeastern University, where I direct the Burnes Center for Social Change and its partner project the Governance Lab and I lead our AI for Impact Coop Program, where we train the next generation of leaders and problem solvers to use AI for social good.

Despite doomerist hype and headlines, artificial intelligence is not sentient. AI comprises a set of data processing tools and methods. IBM puts it simply: “artificial intelligence is a field, which combines computer science and robust datasets, to enable problem-solving.”<a title="" href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3"><!-- [if !supportFootnotes]--><span lang="EN">[3]</span><!--[endif]--></a>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang="EN">Using historical information as input, the computer using machine learning learns to spot patterns and make predictions based on past examples. For example, supplied with 200,000 images of known cancerous tumors, MIT’s Mirai software can analyze new mammogram images and “predict nearly half of all incidences of breast cancer up to five years before they happen.” The tool is equally accurate for both white and Black women.<a title="" href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4"><!-- [if !supportFootnotes]--><span lang="EN">[4]</span><!--[endif]--></a>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang="EN">Such pattern-recognition techniques have powerful relevance for a wide variety of public purposes. The NSF-funded Traffic Jam tool helps law enforcement agencies speed up the identification of human trafficking and find missing persons. Traffic Jam uses machine learning to scour online ads selling sexual services to spot those that mask modern day forms of slavery.<a title="" href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5"><!-- [if !supportFootnotes]--><span lang="EN">[5]</span><!--[endif]--></a></span></p><p><span lang="EN">New generative AI platforms such as ChatGPT (made by OpenAI), Gemini (Google), and Claude (Anthropic) are examples of machine learning tools trained on large datasets of human language. Also known as large-language models, they can generate fluent text. This is what makes these new generative AI applications appear so human rather than machine-like. However, generative AI is not intelligent in any meaningful sense. Having ingested trillions of words as training data, they can replicate the patterns of human language. They do this in essence by predicting the most likely word to come next in a sentence in response to plain language directions, known as prompts.</span></p><p><span lang="EN">Most generative AI systems are “multi-modal,” they work with both spoken and written language. The chatbot, Pi, short for Personal Intelligence, not only types, but it can talk, replicating the affect, tone, and rhythm of human conversation.<a title="" href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6"><!-- [if !supportFootnotes]--><span lang="EN">[6]</span><!--[endif]--></a>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang="EN">Now organizations can also customize their own generative AI, training a model with specific texts and data. Thus, for example, my students in the AI for Impact Coop program at Northeastern are working with the Massachusetts Department of Transportation to create an AI tool to train new engineers.<a title="" href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7"><!-- [if !supportFootnotes]--><span lang="EN">[7]</span><!--[endif]--></a> The chatbot they are building with the agency this spring will be trained exclusively on existing agency documentation and procedures so that new hires can get faster answers to questions about how the agency works.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang="EN">Individuals, too, can take advantage of these build-your-own capabilities without any prior technical knowledge. My son uploaded copies of Shakespeare’s comedies to Google’s free Notebook LM product and the tool quizzed him exclusively on those texts ahead of a school English test, peppering him with customized study questions, (and, yes, he got an A).</span></p><h2><a name="_Toc155554700"></a><span lang="EN">The Power to Create and Analyze</span></h2><p><span lang="EN">Generative AI acts as a next-generation word processor and offers a powerful way to create more accessible and intelligible first drafts of speeches, policy documents and government websites in multiple languages. Jurisdictions like the City of Boston, which encouraged early adoption of and experimentation with generative AI, are now using such tools to write simpler, more intelligible government websites and more compelling job descriptions.<a title="" href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8"><!-- [if !supportFootnotes]--><span lang="EN">[8]</span><!--[endif]--></a>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang="EN">Generative AI image generation platforms Midjourney, Stable Diffusion and DALL-E, which create original images, help with designing arresting website materials to promote tourism and economic development.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang="EN">Yet, the most thrilling aspect of generative and older types of AI lie in their capability to analyze content, even more than create it.</span></p><p><span lang="EN">ChatGPT, Bard, Claude, Pi, and other commercially available generative AI platforms analyze and summarize as well as create text and software code (the language of computers). This capability enables governments to effectively scrutinize and modernize legacy computer code, such as COBOL, a programming language dating back to 1959, which still supports many critical public systems and for which there is a dwindling supply of knowledgeable programmers.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang="EN">In the Office of Innovation in New Jersey, our talented team of engineers, designers and policy professionals who use technology, data and community engagement to build better citizen services, leverages generative AI for scrutinizing and testing software code, aiding in the modernization of complex and dated government systems.<a title="" href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9"><!-- [if !supportFootnotes]--><span lang="EN">[9]</span><!--[endif]--></a> Our engineers have integrated “copilot” tools, which suggest code as they work yielding up to 55% faster code creation.<a title="" href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10"><!-- [if !supportFootnotes]--><span lang="EN">[10]</span><!--[endif]--></a> Like the autocomplete that suggests the next line for your email, such aids speed up software development. Across a wide variety of benefits and services, our team also uses ChatGPT to write software tests, adding more resilience to critical digital applications.</span></p><p><span lang="EN">Image generation platforms Midjourney, Stable Diffusion and DALL-E interpret and explain images in addition to creating them. For example, try snapping a picture of the contents of your refrigerator and asking a platform like DALL-E what to have for dinner. The technology can analyze what’s in the image and make suggestions.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang="EN">For public professionals, the ability to analyze images with older forms of computer vision and newer kinds of generative AI translates into the ability to assess environmental transformations, including deforestation, urban expansion, and climate change impacts, using satellite imagery and photographs. For example, trained on images of past wildfires, ALERTCalifornia’s AI system made Time Magazine’s list of inventions of 2023 because it can scan new images from 1,050 cameras to provide early warnings and reduce the risk of devastating fires. In two months alone, the UC San Diego system spotted 77 wildfires before anyone called them in.<a title="" href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11"><!-- [if !supportFootnotes]--><span lang="EN">[11]</span><!--[endif]--></a>&nbsp;</span></p><p align="center"><span lang="EN"><img src="https://content.thegovlab.com/assets/e63cbcd0-413b-4bea-931c-673561099050?width=1037&amp;height=627" alt="Figure 1">Figure </span><!-- [if supportFields]><span

Ten years ago, it was estimated that 1.8 million scientific journal articles are published each year, and that number has only increased.<a title="" href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12"><!-- [if !supportFootnotes]--><span lang="EN">[12]</span><!--[endif]--></a> In addition, over the last thirty years, the World Wide Web has democratized the ability to communicate. Ironically, by making it easier to speak, the Internet also made it that much harder for us or our institutions to hear one another.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang="EN">This paradox was evident when President Obama’s transition team in 2008, on which I served, invited public ideas for the first 100-day agenda.<a title="" href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13"><!-- [if !supportFootnotes]--><span lang="EN">[13]</span><!--[endif]--></a> The overwhelming response of over 125,000 people contributing 44,000 ideas demonstrated the challenge of too much input and not enough capacity to process it – a real-life example of the adage: “dog chases ambulance, dog catches ambulance.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang="EN">By enabling the public and institutions to be heard and understood, we create new possibilities for enhancing service delivery, supporting public sector workers, strengthening data utilization, bolstering resident engagement, and amplifying problem-solving capabilities.</span></p><p><span lang="EN">I explore each of these impacts of AI briefly, in turn, below, outlining the opportunities for responsibly using AI to support better customer experience.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><span lang="EN">1.&nbsp; Making Government More Intelligible: Creating Conversational Government</span></h2><p><span lang="EN">During the COVID-19 pandemic, New Jersey’s Office of Innovation developed Covid19.nj.gov, a one-stop website providing clear, bilingual answers to public queries. Covid19.nj.gov served 110 million people during the pandemic because we provided plain language responses to questions like “where do I get a vaccine” or “how do I find COVID financial assistance programs for businesses.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang="EN">The COVID Information Hub was, by no means, the only such “one stop” website. However, such centralized information hubs remain the exception, not the norm, in government information dissemination. The complexity of government information can be as perplexing as determining which agency regulates which type of pizza—frozen pepperoni by the USDA; frozen cheese is the FDA.</span></p><p><span lang="EN">Today, AI is making it easier for residents to get answers to their questions without needing to know where to look or even what to look for ahead of time. Now, instead of a one-way, 9-5 broadcast of information, governments could have a 24/7 conversation with residents at the public’s convenience.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang="EN">In New Jersey, for example, we are using generative artificial intelligence to make it easier for residents to get answers to their questions. We have moved many call centers to platforms that support AI-based text-to-speech. This means call center staff can write and publish menu options and messages in multiple languages very quickly, giving the public access to more self-help options.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang="EN">For example, in just the first three months, 15% of those calling in to ask questions about the State’s property tax relief program are resolving their issues successfully through self-serve tools, including web- and phone-based chatbots.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang="EN">The small initial decrease in call volume translates into a 50% increase in the resolution of calls by human operators. Our results are consistent with recent research about private sector call centers. Giving workers access to generative AI that gives real-time recommendations to those answering the phone about how to respond leads, according to MIT professor Erik Brynjolfsson, to “more productive workers, happier customers, and higher employee retention.”<a title="" href="#_edn14" name="_ednref14"><!-- [if !supportFootnotes]--><span lang="EN">[14]</span><!--[endif]--></a> We are also implementing AI-enabled web-based chatbots that answer questions via the Web and text messaging as well as phone.</span></p><p><span lang="EN">New Jersey is not alone in turning to AI to answer resident’s questions and make government more accessible. Back in 2016, the Australian government set up a virtual assistant called Alex to answer questions. In the first 18 months, Alex had over 2 million conversations with an 88% first contact resolution rate, leading to an initial 10% reduction in calls and almost ten million in taxpayer dollars saved through digital self-service.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang="EN">Closer to home, the US Citizenship and Immigration Services has a chatbot called EMMA. Named for poet Emma Lazarus, Emma answers questions about immigration services in both English and Spanish, directing a user to the right place on the website to get an answer to an immigration question. When I worked for the Obama Administration, we set in motion the dream to be able to answer questions about where an immigrant’s application is in the queue, which has rapidly become real.

Families upload their IEP. Families can then securely and privately ask questions in English or Spanish about the document, such as “what are the accommodations to which my child is entitled.” Because generative AI makes creating software so much cheaper and easier, the students built a fully functioning tool in one semester.<a title="" href="#_edn18" name="_ednref18"><!-- [if !supportFootnotes]--><span lang="EN">[18]</span><!--[endif]--></a></span></p><p><span lang="EN">Finally, governments typically organize the delivery of benefits and services in ways that make sense to government bureaucracies, but not necessarily to residents.

Similarly, in the City of Boston, they are integrating generative AI with the City’s open source blogging platform where information is published. Previously, someone wanting to know all the things they need to do if they move to the city (e.g. getting a parking permit for their moving van, obtaining a rental inspection, registering to vote) would have to hunt for this information in dozens of places. Or the City would have had to prepare a guidebook, pulling this information together—and risk missing something or the information becoming out of date.<a title="" href="#_edn19" name="_ednref19"><!-- [if !supportFootnotes]--><span lang="EN">[19]</span><!--[endif]--></a> With generative AI, this information can be extracted automatically across multiple websites, and then checked by government officials.</span></p><p><span lang="EN">When residents get their questions answered faster, they do not need to sit on hold, go to a government office or visit dozens of different websites. Creating a more conversational government decreases the time, aggravation, and cost to taxpayers.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang="EN">Over the next two years, every government agency at every level of government should leverage AI to: 1) offer the ability to ask and get answers to questions about policies, benefits and services 24/7; 2) consistent with longstanding federal requirements, make information available in plain English; and 3) make it easier to get answers, benefits and services from one place and across agencies in ways that are intuitive to residents and those who serve them.</span></p><h2><span lang="EN">2.&nbsp; Making Government More Accessible</span></h2><p><span lang="EN">Generative AI and the large-language models that underlie these tools are trained on text and speech from a variety of languages, enabling them to aid with transcription and translation and creating the opportunity to make government institutions more accessible to more diverse populations.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang="EN">We have already experienced the productivity benefits of AI-enabled transcription when third-party tools like Otter, Woodpecker, and Fireflies (for some reason, AI transcription tools all have cute animal names) transcribe, summarize, and extract action items from our online meetings. Zoom and Teams both have built in AI transcription as well. When we can find the key topics, conclusions, action items, and insights from a meeting, we can work that much more efficiently. The City of Boston is using this summarization capability in an exciting way. The City’s CIO Santiago Garces is supporting the city council using generative AI to automate the creation of summaries of city council meeting minutes and votes. When the public can read a ten-word summary, instead of just a docket number, deliberations become more accessible, transparent, and accountable.<a title="" href="#_edn20" name="_ednref20"><!-- [if !supportFootnotes]--><span lang="EN">[20]</span><!--[endif]--></a>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang="EN">Many government entities are using the ability of AI to transcribe and summarize speech to improve the quality-of-service delivery. In Singapore, for example, the government uses voice transcription to turn emergency calls into text. Their specially trained AI recognizes English, Mandarin and Malay as well as the local “Singlish” inflection. The faster, more accurate logging of calls is designed to improve response time and ensure that first responders have the right information when they respond to a call.<a title="" href="#_edn21" name="_ednref21"><!-- [if !supportFootnotes]--><span lang="EN">[21]</span><!--[endif]--></a>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang="EN">Transcription services are also helping legislatures improve how they work. In India, the parliament’s Digital Sansad software takes advantage of AI to provide members and the public with real-time translation, capturing word-for-word what is said in parliament and translating into one of India's twenty-two regional languages and dialects.<a title="" href="#_edn22" name="_ednref22"><!-- [if !supportFootnotes]--><span lang="EN">[22]</span><!--[endif]--></a> In the Netherlands, Speech2Write not only turns speech into text but it turns spoken text into edited, written reports.

For example, researchers at Meta mined ten thousand hours of spoken texts for the most common languages (e.g., English, Chinese, Russian, Spanish, French, Japanese and German) and a thousand hours for other languages to create Seamless4MT (Massively Multilingual &amp; Multimodal Machine Translation). SeamlessM4T offers text and speech translation in an impressive array of languages. Type any one of 101 languages and the tool will translate or voice what you said in any one of 36 languages, from Chinese to Tagalog to Western Persian. The AI model can handle several languages at the same time and combine speech and text translation. The tool is open source and therefore can be freely incorporated into other applications.<a title="" href="#_edn24" name="_ednref24"><!-- [if !supportFootnotes]--><span lang="EN">[24]</span><!--[endif]--></a></span></p><p><span lang="EN">With machine translation platforms such as SeamlessM4T or Google Translate and other specialty platforms for minoritized and indigenous languages, it is becoming faster and more cost effective to do translation. We can now translate government policies, procedures, forms, services, and education into multiple languages. Imagine how much better a public hospital can serve its populations, especially its veterans, when services are available in their language. Imagine how much better a resident can navigate city hall, the courthouse or the DMV when they can understand the instructions. Imagine how much more economically competitive our children will be when they can enjoy robust bilingual education enabled by AI.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang="EN">The breakthroughs that paved the way for generative AI have enabled us to make radical progress in the fidelity, accuracy and speed of machine translation, enhancing accessibility and inclusivity. Because machine translation is so fast, it will be especially useful in emergencies when there is a need to disseminate time-sensitive information, as we saw during COVID. Of course, human translators are still essential for capturing nuance.</span></p><p><span lang="EN">Over the next two years, government agencies should use machine translation, even if imperfect, to translate all resources into multiple languages for easier and more efficient access and understanding by residents.</span></p><h2><span lang="EN">3.&nbsp; Making Public Professionals More Effective: Supporting Public Workers with AI</span></h2><p><span lang="EN">To make it easier for public professionals to do their jobs well, many jurisdictions are also building employee chatbots.

In New Jersey, where we design government operations with rather than for residents to ensure that we are prioritizing information and services that residents tell us they want, we actively invite citizen comment. For example, in support of unemployment insurance claims, we receive thousands of comments from residents, giving us feedback. We would need an army of personnel that we do not have to read through all the comments. Instead, AI parses the comments, removes the filler, and tells our team what information the public wants.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang="EN">For instance, during tax season last year we saw lots of questions about where to find a previous year’s 1099 forms, so we were able to move the answer to that question front and center, reducing call volumes and satisfying demand.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang="EN">Amsterdam is doing something similar with the data from its version of 311 calls.

The current absence of data on federal employee training prevents managers, researchers, and taxpayers from properly evaluating these training initiatives.

Many tech professionals have signed a manifesto that alarmingly declares: “Contemporary AI systems are now becoming human-competitive at general tasks, and we must ask ourselves: Should we let machines flood our information channels with propaganda and untruth? Should we automate away all the jobs, including the fulfilling ones? Should we develop nonhuman minds that might eventually outnumber, outsmart, obsolete and replace us? Should we risk loss of control of our civilization?”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang="EN">But the doomsday prognosticating is only half the story. These remarkable technologies for organizing information could hold the key to designing better institutions, capable of listening and learning more efficiently, and responding more effectively to the challenges of our times. If we want to realize the benefits of these powerful technologies for improving governance, strengthening resident engagement, and deepening democracy, we must invest more in creating that future.</span><span lang="EN">&nbsp;</span></p><div><h2><span lang="EN">Notes</span><!-- [if !supportEndnotes]--></h2><!--[endif]--><div id="edn1"><p><a title="" href="#_ednref1" name="_edn1"><span lang="EN"><!-- [if !supportFootnotes]--><span lang="EN">[1]</span><!--[endif]--></span></a> <span lang="EN">Non-Endorsement: The technologies referenced in this document are discussed as examples of artificial intelligence tools in use in government to improve customer experience.
